AUTHORS: Advit Mehla
USER INSTRUCTIONS: After Running GreenFoot Code Instructions are Provided

GRADING: 
I think this project deserves a level 4/4+ because I included all level 4 requirements and made an enjoyable game with difficulty progression, collision detection, special features like the invincibility ability and I included all Gamestates and made the game replayable with random variables every time that you play. The game doesnt get boring and their is a clear goal that you are trying to achieve the highest score possible, I also think that I made it look good and made it a very smooth experience. 

ADDED FEATURES:
Start Screen” - provides the users instructions and a button to start the game.
User Controlled Car - A car which the user controls manually.
End State - Game ends after player runs out of health
Obstacles - 2 Obstacles each with different movement for the player to have collision with
Progression - Game gets harder as more obstacles spawn and they get faster as time goes on, everything is based off of your score, higher score harder game.
Score - Score is tracked and Displayed at end
End Screen - Screen that Displays result and Score
Replayability - Game is Replayable and has random elements each time
Full documentation of code 
Regular commits to git with my changes(mostly in class)
Invincibility Ability - User gets a special ability where they are untouched by obstacles for 5 seconds and continuing gaining score
Help Screen Demo - To get the player familiar with the game they may practice movement before they get started
